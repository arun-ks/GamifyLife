# Gamify Your Life

This excel based tool gamifies your life using logs of your activities. The idea is to use the techniques used in video/arcade games to help people motivate and to track progress.

You can assign +ive points for good habits/behavior & -ive for bad ones. 

## How does it work

> "Your actions become your habits"

Each activity is associated with some points (+ive for good things, -ive for bad ones). As you log activities, the excel will calculate your health-status.
